json serializer (serialize, deserialize)
	json.Marshal/Unmarshal (panic, log, etc.)

deserialization_handler
	Listen to deliveries and pipe them to deserializer
	Pipe results to the application

RetryWriter
	Receive dispatches and buffer them locally
	Retry n times with sleep interval of X
	(any messages that have expired will not be written)
	(which means that the work will gradually decrease to zero)

RetryCommitWriter
	Receive dispatches and buffer them locally
	If commit fails, retry n times with sleep interval of X
	(any messages that have expired will not be written)
	(which means that the work will gradually decrease to zero)

serialization writer
	Takes "Message" property on Dispatch
	and serializes it if not already done
	and then clears out Message property?
