interface for Writer and CommitWriter should be *TOTALLY* different

this prevents a Writer from being used place of a commit writer
and then commit never gets called

web/ResponseWriter helper methods, e.g. status codes with message, etc. etc.
web/constants with mime types, e.g. application/json application/javascript text/xml, text/plain, etc.
