json serializer (serialize, deserialize)
	json.Marshal/Unmarshal (panic, log, etc.)

deserialization_handler
	Listen to deliveries and pipe them to deserializer
	Pipe results to the application

serialization writer
	Takes "Message" property on Dispatch
	and serializes it if not already done
	and then clears out Message property?



interface for Writer and CommitWriter should be *TOTALLY* different
for the Write() method, e.g. return the error and not

this prevents a Writer from being used place of a commit writer
and then commit never gets called
